The Text Adventure Clue
by: Joseph Bateh

//////////////////

This was the final project of COP3502, the first programming class I took.

//////////////////

Available Actions:

go - enables the player to go to a room.

look - shows a description of the room, the character in the room, and the weapon in the room.

guess - allows the player to make a guess about the character, room, and weapon involved in the murder. Be careful, you only get 10 guesses. (Format is: “guess character room weapon”).

call - allows the player to make an accusation. If the accusation is correct you win. Otherwise you lose. You must be in the basement to call the police, because that is where the phone is located. (Format is: “call character room weapon”).

examine - used to examine objects in the room, if there are any.

use* - allows the player to use the object in the room. (If there is one that is able to be used).

map - reveals a map of the mansion.

help - self explanatory I would hope.

HINT: For some objects there is not a way to use it, but there is another action you can do. One alternate action will reveal the answers. If you can figure out what that action is, congratulations.

//////////////////

* not necessarily the word use, but some action.

The map image is from google. I typed in “clue map” into Google. That is not my picture, so yeah.
